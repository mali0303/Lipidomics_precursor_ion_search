# Lipidomics_precursor_ion_search
Searches for lipid precursor ions on Lipids database at the given tolerance level using LIPID MAPS API

This program performs MS precursor ion search on the LIPIDS database using Python-based REST API (REpresentational State Transfer Application Programming Interface). LIPID MAPS (https://www.lipidmaps.org/) has made available REST services (https://www.lipidmaps.org/resources/REST/index.php) which allow many programming languages including Python to interact with datasets using HTTP requests. Deploying a python API for this task enables high throughput search and allows for more dynamic control of search parameters. It also facilitates effective downstream processing of search results by making them programmatically accessible and integrating them in a larger data processing pipeline.

I wrote a python script that reads m/z values of precursor ions and desired tolerance levels from a CSV file (precursor_ions.csv) using Pandas library and iteratively performs ion search on the database over all available adducts. I used Python’s Requests library to make the HTTP request and the content of the LIPID MAPS server’s response was transformed into a file object using StringIO. This file object was fed into the Pandas library which creates a data frame of lipid compounds of matching m/z. The final results are compiled into a single CSV file saved as "Results.csv" in the working directory.
